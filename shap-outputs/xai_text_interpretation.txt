Clinical interpretation examples (adapt to your dataset):

- Progressive motility (Grade A) is typically associated with high VSL (straight-line velocity) and high LIN (linearity).
- High VCL but low VSL/LIN often indicates curvilinear or non-linear movement (Grade B).
- Very low VSL (<5 μm/s) corresponds to non-progressive (Grade C) or immotile (Grade D) sperm.
- High ALH with low STR may indicate vigorous but non-linear motion (often seen in Grade B).
- BCF contributes to distinguishing motility vigor and may correlate with VCL/ALH patterns.
